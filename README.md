SolanaGo is a decentralized Go AI program implemented on Solana blockchain, which adapts the AlphaGo Zero paper
    "Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge"
into Web3 infrastructure.It pioneers the integration of blockchain technology with artificial intelligence in the domain of
    Go / Weiqi game.
SolanaGo represents a new paradigm in decentralized AI gaming, where:

        Game states are recorded on Solana blockchain AI computations are distributed and verifiable Players can earn rewards through participation The system is governed by DAO

        If you use SolanaGo in your project, please consider mentioning in your README.If you use SolanaGo in your research,
        please consider citing the library as follows:
        Copy @misc {
            SolanaGo2024,
            title = {
                SolanaGo
            },
            year = {
                2024
            },
            journal = {
                GitHub repository
            },

        }
        Building and Running On Linux Requirements

        GCC with C++11 support Bazel(0.19 .2 is known - good) Solana CLI tools(Optional) CUDA and cuDNN
        for GPU support(Optional) TensorRT(
            for accelerating computation on GPU, 3.0 .4 is known - good)

        Setting up Solana Development Environment Before starting, you need to:

        Install Solana CLI tools Create a Solana wallet Get some SOL tokens
        for development Configure your Solana development environment

        See Solana Developer Guide
        for detailed instructions.Building SolanaGo with Bazel Clone the repository and configure the building:
        Copy$ git clone https: //github.com/SolanaGO/SolanaGO-v.0.0.1
        $ cd SolanaGo $. / configure
        . / configure will:

        Start the bazel configuration Set up Solana network connections Configure CUDA and TensorRT
        if needed

        Then build with bazel:
        Copy$ bazel build //mcts:mcts_main
        Dependencies such as Tensorflow and Solana client libraries will be downloaded automatically.The building process may take a long time
        .Running SolanaGo Download and extract the trained network:
        Copy$ wget https: //github.com/SolanaGO/SolanaGO-v.0.0.1/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
        $ tar xvzf trained - network - v1.tar.gz The SolanaGo engine supports:

        Traditional GTP(Go Text Protocol) Blockchain interaction through Solana Program Interface Web3 wallet integration Smart contract game state management

        You can use it with:

        GTP - capable GUIs like Sabaki Web3 - enabled interfaces Command - line tools Decentralized applications(dApps)

        Running Modes 1) Quick Start
Run the engine: scripts / start.sh
This will:

    Detect available GPUs
Connect to configured Solana network
Initialize smart contracts
Run mcts_main with proper configuration
Write logs to log directory

2) Advanced Configuration
For full control over options:
    Copy$ bazel - bin / mcts / mcts_main--gtp--config_path = etc / mcts_1gpu.conf--solana - network = devnet--
    logtostderr--v = 0
Blockchain Integration
SolanaGo includes several blockchain - specific features:

    Game State Management

Move validation on - chain
State persistence
History tracking


Token Economics

Player rewards
Staking mechanism
Tournament prize pools


Governance

DAO voting
Protocol upgrades
Parameter tuning



Configure Guide
Important configurations include standard Go AI options and blockchain - specific settings:
    AI Engine Options

num_eval_threads: should equal to the number of GPUs
num_search_threads: should be slightly larger than num_eval_threads * eval_batch_size
timeout_ms_per_step: time allowed
for each move

Blockchain Options

solana_network: mainnet, testnet, or devnet
contract_address: deployed program address
wallet_path: path to wallet keypair
transaction_timeout: maximum wait time
for transaction confirmation

    [Additional configuration details omitted
        for brevity]
Analysis Tools
SolanaGo provides both traditional Go analysis and blockchain - specific analytics:
    Game Analysis

Move prediction accuracy
Win rate estimation
Position evaluation

Blockchain Analytics

Transaction history
Token economics metrics
Network performance statistics
